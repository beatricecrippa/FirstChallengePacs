Good use of GitHub, README is clear and complete.

Avoid implementing all the functions in the main.cpp file.
You could also separate the definition of the Data struct and the definition of all the functions for vector operations and computation of the learning rate and numerical gradient.
The implementation of the methods of classes should be done outside, to improve readability of the code.

Rely on methods of the std library to implement operations between vectors.
Avoid using std::pow and rely on other implementations, as seen in the labs.
